### jahhein.codingbat

I have more copy and pasting to do for all the answers and files I have.


This is my set of answers for each problem. Many answers submitted also has more answers
added below or around the source code that I have commented out. 
Each section has it's own .java file with each method name being the same as is online. A Javadoc above each
method is directly from the question online.


### What are these .iml files? (Intellij IDEA Module)

These are files specific for Jet Brains' Intellij IDEA IDE. Please simply delete them if you do not
use Intellij IDEA. 

I have left them in for ease of those using Intellij to add them as modules.

For more information on the Intellij IDEA IDE please see this link: [Jetbrains]
